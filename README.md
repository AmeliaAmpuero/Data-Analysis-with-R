<h1>Data Analysis with R
<h2>MODULE 1: Introduction to Data Analysis with R</h2>
I learned how to approach data analysis by identifying real-world problems and understanding how data can help answer key questions. Using R, I explored essential tools and packages for data analysis, which allow for efficient data manipulation and visualization. I also practiced importing datasets into R and extracting initial insights, setting the foundation for deeper analysis.
 
<h2>MODULE 2: Data Wrangling</h2>
I gained hands-on experience in data wrangling, an essential step in preparing data for analysis. I learned how to clean and preprocess raw data by handling missing values, transforming data formats, normalizing values, and categorizing information through data binning. Additionally, I worked on converting categorical variables into numerical formats to enhance analysis accuracy and ensure compatibility across datasets.

<h2>MODULE 3: Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
I developed skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand dataset characteristics, uncover variable relationships, and extract meaningful insights. Through EDA techniques, I analyzed factors affecting flight delays, identifying key trends and patterns. This process helped me recognize which variables were most relevant to the problem I was solving.

<h2>MODULE 4: Model Development in R</h2>
I applied machine learning techniques to develop predictive models in R. Using the Airline dataset, I built a model to predict flight arrival delays. I implemented regression techniques to evaluate variable correlations and assessed model accuracy using both visualizations and statistical metrics. This experience strengthened my ability to translate real-world problems into data-driven solutions.

<h2>MODULE 5: Model Evaluation R</h2>
I deepened my understanding of model evaluation using the tidymodels framework, which follows tidyverse principles for machine learning. I performed cross-validation to ensure model reliability and learned how to detect and mitigate common issues like overfitting and underfitting. Additionally, I applied regularization techniques and fine-tuned models using grid search to optimize performance.

<h2>MODULE 6: Course Project</h2>
In my final project, I applied my R skills to analyze real-world weather data collected from the NOAA weather station at JFK Airport in New York. As a data scientist for a weather forecasting firm, I explored various climatological variables such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and pressure to predict precipitation patterns. My analysis provided stakeholders with a high-level understanding of historical and current weather conditions, helping to identify key weather trends and insights.
